    "The consumer division of Harold's company has decided to offer budgeting and financial planning services to customers. They want to build a report for customers that links to their banking and investment accounts and automatically refreshes the data and charts on login. However, some of the calculations are tricky, and Harold could really use some help connecting the accounts and simulating the retirement investment projections. Luckily, there are APIs available to obtain account transactions and fetch retirement portfolio prices.\n",

    "Harold was really impressed with your work on this planner, but commented that 30 years seems like such a long time to wait to retire! Harold starts wondering if the retirement plan could be adjusted to retire earlier than normal. Try adjusting the portfolio to either include more risk (a higher stock than bond ratio) or to have a larger initial investment and rerun the retirement analysis to see what it would take to retire in five years instead of 30!\n",
